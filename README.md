## What Is This Website For?

Built with React, the website is designed to be modular, relying on yarn as the package bundler and markdown files (GFM, flavoured) to store the main contents. We think of packageable as its design is meant to be shwon across portable mediums such as exhibition spaces or locations where the internet may not be readily available.

Just `yarn install` inside the folder and you are good to go.

## The contents

THe pages, which are the contents for this website are pulled from a separate repository. That repoistory contains information and my research notes.
