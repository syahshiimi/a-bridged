# The Digital Compendium To Land Surveying: For amateurs by amateurs 
*The Digital Compendium To Land Surveying For Amateurs* by Amateurs is part of a larger body of work investigating into the colonia violence and subdued history that persists in maps.

If you came from the exhibition's QR code or browsed this page by chance, ensure you have watched the video beforehand, if you wish to do so.

# What is this tutorial for?

Although the tools you may see in the exhibtion were fabricated specifically for the show, you can also make these sculptures on your own if you wish to do so. Although I mention the word sculpture, please feel free to treat these sculptures as tools which they are originally intended to be for.

In this web documentation, you can find below links to the materials purchased.

# Obtaining The Materials

The items used in the sculptures can be purchased in the links below. Feel free to purchase whatever amount you wish to purchase of these materials.

## Metal Pole Rods

The metal pole rods are an essential component to produce the sculptures and tools used for land surveying. They are, quite literally, the backbone of your potential cadastral survey.

There are many type of metal rods out there, especially on e-commerce stores. There are also many with good reviews online but often fall short when they are delivered to your house.

Fret not, I have done the research and testing for you. Instead of offering what is good, I will list down what to avoid first.

1. **Avoid spring-supported extendable rods**. Although these are lightweight and cheaper (some boasting up to 30kg weight capacity), don't be fooled. There are often nothing more than two poles where one is slotted into the other and weigh freely by an internal spring.

	These types are to be avoided. They will rattle and make your surveying experience a nightmare.
	
2. **Avoid pole rods beyond 3m**. Make your life easier, you don't need a pole that long. 

3. **Avoid curtain rods**. Although they may seem easier to work with simply because of their price and availability, curtain rods are too thin in its diameter. They can bend easily and piling them into groud will be difficult.

## GPS Pole

The GPS Pole (sometimes called GNSS) is an interesting device. 

Interesting because a professional one costs thousands of dollars and has a computer built into it. But you know what's more interesting? We have a computer in our pockets and a GPS device built into one. Yes, your phone.

For this GPS Pole, the only few things you may wish to need are:

1. A metal pole
2. A mobile phone holder

I bought a used mobile phone online.

## Plastic Dropsheet

I love dropsheets. The way it floats and the texture it has -- maybe its the plasticity that attracts me to it. I'm not sure.

Get a plastic dropsheet if you are painting on a clean surface. This is necesary.

## Links
These are a list of rods that you may want to buy from. Note how they are thicker in diameter. I am not sure what theser rods are used for, maybe even for curtains. Although it may see m that I contradicted myself, these are **thicker** curtain rods.

# Crafting The Survey Rod

The build recipe for the **one** survey rod is as such:

1. One canister of Nippon Pylox 'Jialang Red' spray paint
2. One canister of Nippon Pylox 'White' spray paint
3. One canister of Krylon 'Dark Grey' Primer
4. 220 grit sandpaper
5. 480 grit sandpaper
6. Nippon Painters Tape (**Japan Version, please**)
7. One metal rod

The total cost of these items should be no more than $50. If you wish to make more than one survey rod, then you it could potentially be cheaper as you can split the cost of the materials. Most of these items can be purchased from your local hardware shop. 

## Step 1: Priming The Surface

Paint sticks better on rougher surfaces, especially if you are using spray paints. As the metal rod would typically feel smooth, priming the surface is an important step to obtain a nice even texture.

Here, we will use these items:

1. 220 grit sandpaper
2. 480 sandpaper
3. Krylon 'Dark Grey' Primer

### Sanding the surface with 220 grit sandpaper

Get a 220 grit sandpaper and begin sanding the smooth surface of the metal pole. Although the metal rod may *feel* rough, sanding it down with 220 grit will bring it to a roughter texture. 

Avoid sanding too hard or pressing hard onto the metal surface to avoid scuffing the metal pole.

### Sanding the surface with 420 grit sandpaper

We will now use a 420 grit sandpaper to 'smoothen' the texture and even out potential scuff marks. 

**This step is optional**. 

### Priming the surface

Before priming the surface with the dark grey Krylox primer, we will clean the sanded surface with a dry cloth first. We do this to remove any sanded particles which would remain on the sanded surface.

After wiping down the sanded surface with a dry cloth, we can begin priming the metal rod. 

Spray the dark grey primer onto the sanded metal pole. Ensure even coverage and take your time to do a few several coats.

The end result should be a dark gray, smooth matte finish.

## Step 2: Taping The Surfaces

To get the signature, red and white look; we will tape the surface in intervals of 20cm. This means that each colored section on the metal pole is approximately 20cm. Taping the surface is important so that we can get a clean and finished look.

**Image of step 1**

Start from the bottom of the pole. Measure 20cm and use the painter's tape to mark out **outside** of the 20cm.


**Image of step 2**

Afterwards, measure from the start of the painter's tape you had just taped on and measure 20cm. This time, use the painter's tape and tape on the **inside** of the 20cm.


**Image of step 3**

This means that the allocation of distances between tape markers are **not equal**. This method of measurement ensures that we have 20cm for eac colored section (red & white) by **including** the length of the tape into the overall step of 'striping' the pole.

Confused? Look at this image for a visual explaination.

## Step 3: Painting The First Stripe

At this point, it is really up to you which color you wish to paint it first. I personally went for red because it might be easier. Feel free to do whichever that comes first.

The same technique applies when you are 'priming' the metal pole. Ensure that you get good and even coverage across all faces of the pole.

The end result should look something like this. 

**Image of spray painted pole w/o white section**

## Step 4: Taping The Next Surface

After painting the surface, we will begin taping up for the next section. If you painted white first then you should be painting red, vice versa. 

A quick hack at this point is to not re-measure. Just shift the painter's tape which were used as markers up or down from its initial position.

The idea here is to **cover** the section is what painted first. The end result should reveal a sanded but unpainted metal pole surface that is approximately 20cm. I say approximately here because we don't care about making it accurate. 

We're not professionals, just amateurs.

## Step 5: Painting The Second Stripe

The steps are the same for step 3. If you painted white first, now you paint with red, vice versa.

## Outcome

The final result should look something like this.

Lucky for you, i've already took the chance to stake it into the ground ðŸ˜š.

# Crafting The GNSS Pole

The next part of this tutorial, we will go through on how you can use the the materials you had also used to create the survey rod to create a GNSS Pole.

The build recipe for the GNSS Pole is as such:

1. One  UGREEN Bicycle Phone Holder
2. One Metal Rod
3. One Used Mobile Phone (I prefer IPhones)
4. A Used Router

> Perhaps the odd one out here is the router. I found it quite interesting that during testing, the router although inactivate but semi-attached to the metal rod, produced greater results compared to not using one. It could be that the router itself is a receiver of some sort and reflects/deflects/pulls in signals. I am not sure. I am not a scientist or an engineer, just some amateur.

We will also be reusing many of the other materials that we used to construct the survey ranging rod. I will list dowm again.

2. One canister of Nippon Pylox spray paint (any color)
3. One canister of Krylon 'Dark Grey' Primer
4. 220 grit sandpaper
5. 480 grit sandpaper
6. Nippon Painters Tape (**Japan Version, please**)
7. One metal rod

## Step 1: Priming the Surface

## Step 2: Painting to Your Color

## Step 3: Polyurethane Coating  for Protection

## Step 4: Attaching the Phone Mount

## Step 5: Attaching the Router
